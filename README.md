## Give me my colors :~~

------

See example of app:

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkdizajn/my-colors/master/ja.jpeg "My picture")

You can use this app in a way to send your picture url in a form of url get parameter named 'i'.

http://givememycolors-kpendic.rhcloud.com/?i=https://nutty.io/images/nutty.png

*?i=(here paste your picture url)*

Only 'i' variable is acceptable, ofcorse if you don't want to see my pretty face all the time :)

And you will get your most used colors in picture.

Columns are as folows:

1. color sample
2. percentage of color in picture
3. hex color value


## Use it as a API

Simply rename the parameter 'i' to 'j' :)

-----------------
that's it :)

cheers, k.
